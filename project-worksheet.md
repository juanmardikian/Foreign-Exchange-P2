# Project Overview


## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.


## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|Jan 23th| Project Prompt | Incomplete
|Jan 23rd| Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Functional Components | Incomplete
|Jan 24th| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|Jan 25th| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|Jan 26th| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|Jan 27th| MVP | Incomplete
|Jan 31tst| Present | Incomplete


## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

## API Snippet

```
Paste a snippet from your API here that shows the shape of the data
```

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add user auth

## React Component Hierarchy

Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` x and y Matrix.

## Functional Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description |Type |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | |
| Footer | This will render the footer include the nav | |

## Timeframes

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.


| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
