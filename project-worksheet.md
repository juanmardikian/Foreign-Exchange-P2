### MVP

The whole purpose will be to see different ratios of currencies compare agaist the mighty US dollar

#### MVP EXAMPLE:
- Find and use external api that works and five real data time
- Display the comparation against other currencies
- Allow user to choose favorites currencies


### Post-MVP

I will try to add a favorite bar or searched, and add charts and graphics in the web

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE:
- Add favourite pair of currencies

## React Component Hierarchy

Hierarchy and architectural design of my app

## Timeframes

I have no idea, I calculate that the hardest part will be trying to make the components and make them interact. Plus, my main goal is to finish the React part as soon as posible, get all the data from the API that I need and filtered, and start with the dinamic CSS and HTML in order to make it look great



## Project Schedule

## Issues and Resolutions

Learn React, how to base my whole project on React, and understand it

## Code Snippet

Not yet, but probably axios

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
