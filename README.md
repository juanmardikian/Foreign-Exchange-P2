# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project 2: React
#### Overview

Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern front end application using React!

Like with project one, our Unit 2 project is a chance to be creative and build something you can be proud of. You will be working individually for this project, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. 

As part of this project, you'll be required to show your project to your instructors and classmates in a presentation. Your goal for this is to extract the most important aspects of what went into building your project into easy-to-use language and practice speaking about your code.

Show us what you've got!

## Requirements

#### Your website must:

- Be a working, interactive, React application.
- Include data from a third-party API.
    - Pull data into the application using an API  
        [List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)  
        [More APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)  
    - TRY OUT your API in the browser, or with Postman, by making an axios request to make sure it works the way you expect it to. **YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SHOW US YOU CAN RECEIVE THE DATA FOR YOUR PROPOSAL**
- Use React Router installed using npm or yarn. At least 2 functional routes.
- Have at least 6 separate components, using a readable file structure.
- Have at 1 component that is nested 3 components deep.
- Include a conditionally rendered component. One idea is rending a "loading" component while waiting for your API response.
- Be styled with CSS, with at least 1 break point for Responsive Design. Flexbox and Grid are highly encouraged.
- Use class and functional components appropriately. If you use all functional components use hooks, class components will use lifecyle methods.
- Be deployed via GitHub or Surge.

- **Optionally, you may incorporate a component library to design your app with approval**

#### Your code must:

- Be properly formatted and indented.  
- Be written with semantic, camelCase JavaScript variable names.  
- Be written with kebab-case (dashes) CSS class and id names.  
- Contain no `console.log()` or commented out code in final version. Commented notes are fine. 
- Use only React for DOM manipulation (no event listeners)

## Necessary Deliverables
#### A comprehensive README.md file

**Refer to the [project worksheet](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-nyc-blizzard/project-2/blob/master/project-worksheet.md) file in this repo for structuring your README.**

#### For the proposal:
- A name and description of the project you'll be building with the objective described in non-technical language.
- A link to the API you plan to use. 
- A snippet of json from a working call to your API.
- A collection of wireframes, hand-drawn or digitally created, outlining the important pages of your site, as well as the critical states of your project.
- A section clearly defining MVP and POST MVP.
- A component hierarchy that shows the flow of data between components.
- A listing of all major components used in the app with a description of each.
- A priority matrix showing the areas of development for your project on an x/y axis where x is time and y priority.
- How long you anticipate spending on each area of development.
- A project schedule showing what you plan to accomplish for each day of the project week.
- If you plan on incorporating a component library, include a link in your proposal.
- A list of obstacles you anticipate facing during development and how you plan to overcome them.

#### For the project:
- A git repository hosted on GitHub Enterprise, with a link to your hosted project.
- **Frequent** commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- DO NOT build your app in this repository. YOU MUST initiate a new repo on your GitHub Enterprise account.
- Keep an updated list of obstacles you encountered during development and document their resolutions.
- Include a code snippet in your readme of something you are proud of or something you find interesting and explain it.
- Include a change log in your readme of any major changes you made to the planning of your project with a reasoning behind each change.

## A Note on Plagiarism

General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating. It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community. Any work considered to have been plagiarized will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements. If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.” Any student found plagiarizing or attempting to plagiarize will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project. However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and StackOverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
- Turning in work that is not your own.
- Turning in someone else's work as your own.
- Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
- Copying words or code without giving credit.
- Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
- Giving incorrect information about a source.
- Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
- Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
- Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
